# RPS Online
Replication of original RPS online in React technology

## What is RPS online?
RPS online was a java game developed by Redboss Games company founded in Czech Republic by Jan Rehab. The RPS stands for rock paper scissors
but it wasn't just any simple game. It was catchy, fast-paced, easy and enjoyable. The UI, figures and animations were flawless not mentioning 
those funny sounds the game produced.

## How did it all started?
It was around summer exam period when I surfed internet as usually and found out that ICQ became open-source. Suddenly, I remembered the 
good times when I played RPS online with my friends and it hit me â€“ why not download and play it? Unfortunately, Xtraz, which was the 
ICQ game centre, extracted and deleted all of its content two years ago so there's no way to play it anymore. I didn't want to give up 
on this thought just because of this stupid obstacle so I started to look up through internet if by chance there's another way to obtain 
this gold. About 30 minutes later I still haven't found anything. Decided on giving up, another idea popped up in my head and that was 
to try to replicate this game.
